# Omnium Flavor Analysis â€“ Sparkling Ice

This project was completed during my internship at **Omnium**, focusing on evaluating the market potential of new flavors for Talking Rainâ€™s **Sparkling Ice** brand.

## Project Overview
The goal was to develop a repeatable, quantitative framework for estimating how new flavors might perform in the market.  
Key methods included:

- **Flavor Indices:** Constructed velocity-based indices to benchmark flavors against brand and category averages.  
- **Multiple Approaches:** Explored average velocity indexing, percentile ranking, and benchmarking against reference flavors.  
- **Flavorâ€“Brand Regression Model:** Implemented a regression framework to control for brand effects, providing interpretable, scale-free indices for every flavor.  
- **Projections:** Applied indices to project sales opportunities for hypothetical soda-style flavors (cola, cream soda, root beer, Dr. Pepper-style).

## Key Findings
- Cola and soda-style flavors showed strong potential, particularly in 12-pack formats.  
- Methodology generalizes beyond Sparkling Ice and can be adapted to other brands and categories.

## Limitation
- Results are sensitive to brand comparison set selection, making careful definition of comparison groups essential.

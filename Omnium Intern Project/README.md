# Omnium Intern Project — Seasonality Clustering

This project was completed during my internship at **Omnium** in Summer 2025.  
It explores seasonality-based clustering methods for consumer packaged goods data, applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering with custom distance metrics to improve pricing regressions and demand modeling.

# Exploring 2022 Indian NGO Distribution

This project was created as part of my research for the **Data Science Discovery Program** at UC Berkeley, in collaboration with **Daanmatch**. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing the distribution of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) across India.

## Overview

Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in addressing social, economic, and environmental issues in India. This project explores the regional distribution of NGOs and how these organizations are spread across different states. The findings are aimed at improving resource allocation and support mechanisms for NGOs operating in underrepresented areas.

The project included data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, culminating in a **poster presentation** at the Data Science Discovery Program Symposium held on May 1, 2024.

### Key Objectives:
- Map the geographic distribution of NGOs in India.
- Identify regions with a high concentration of NGOs and those with fewer resources.
- Provide insights to Daanmatch for strategic planning and support of NGOs in underserved areas.

## Deliverables

- **Poster**: You can view the poster summarizing the findings in this GitHub Repository.  

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Poster design tools (Canva)

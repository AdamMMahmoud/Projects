# Modeling π and e through Approximation and Application

**Authors**: Adam Mahmoud & Jack Galetti  
**Course**: Physics 77 - Capstone Report  

## Overview

This project approximates π and e using various methods, including Monte Carlo simulations, geometric techniques, and infinite series. These approximations are applied to simulate a damped pendulum to observe real-world physics phenomena.

## Key Methods

- π Approximations: Monte Carlo, polygon perimeter, Leibniz series, Wallis product, Buffon’s needle.
- e Approximation: Numerical integration.
- Application: Damped pendulum simulation using the approximated constants.

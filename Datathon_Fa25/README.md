# College Match & ROI Explorer

This project was created for the **2025 UC Berkeley Datathon — Track 2 (Advanced Track)**.  
It builds an equity-focused college recommendation system that ranks schools based on **similarity to student preferences** and a calculated **return-on-investment score** using affordability and outcome data.
